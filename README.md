I am currently pursuing a degree in **Business Informatics** with a strong interest in **frontend development**. My experience includes working with **JavaScript** and **Python**, where I focus on building intuitive and aesthetically pleasing web applications that enhance user experience. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am keen on exploring the creative aspects of web development and interactive technologies.

- **Technologies**: Basic working knowledge of Java, C++, TypeScript, Angular, RAG, and Google Blockly.

## ðŸš€ Current Projects

### Bachelor Thesis

My current research involves the development of a web-based platform for **Visual Programming of Microcontrollers**, aimed at facilitating programming education in student workshops. This platform will enable students to understand core concepts of microcontroller programming through an interactive, visual approach.

### Web Development Project

I am developing a low-code platform that allows users to create simple multiplayer games directly in their web browser. The goal is to make game development accessible to those without extensive programming knowledge, by providing an intuitive, visual development environment.
